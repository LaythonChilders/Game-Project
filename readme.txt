The year is 1997. It's a Friday night. You're sitting down after dinner, finally ready to unwind after a long week. 
It's December, but you haven't had the time to take down your Thanksgiving or Halloween decorations. 
Your place is a mess, but at least it's festive.

You boot up your Nintendo64 and put your feet up, getting ready to annihilate some demons in Doom64. 
All at once, a ball of soft white fur has found it's way into your lap. Your cat Snowflake curls up and begins purring, 
getting ready for a nap as you start blasting away. The sounds of screeching demons and shotgun reloads continue 
emanating from your Nintendo, as Snowflake begins to fall into a deep, deep slumber.....

As Snowflake falls asleep, the sounds of Doom64 infiltrate her dreams, and she finds herself face to face 
with her own demons. The conglomeration of all three seasons have manifested into a horrific nightmare!! 
Snowflake's only hope of a good night's rest is to use lethal force against any festive demon that dares to cross 
her path....
